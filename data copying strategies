Notes on copying data from source to target db

When about to start comparing the 2 databases, lock all tables in both databases.

Examine what fields are being copied.

case A) If we aren't copying uniques or pks, or we are copying them but they are also being compared
	simple insert
case B) else if we are copying pk, or we are copying non compared uniques and there is no pk
	insert on duplicate ignore
case C) else (if there is a pk and we're not copying it, and we are copying uniques which aren't being compared
	work out which uniques already exist, update them with insert on update ignore, insert the rest



In analyzeTableSyncGlobalUnique() (not the subset one because it doesn't deal with real uniques)
When it fetches the uniques from the target-db, if there is a pk-field then make it fetch that too. Save that too in SynkaTableColumn->allUniques(as val while unique is key?)
Then when comitting the data and finding there are dupes by looking at allUniques, we can just get the id from it too and add to the rows to be updated.
