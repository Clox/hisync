Notes on copying data from source to target db

When about to start comparing the 2 databases, lock all tables in both databases.

Examine what fields are being copied.

Then when copying data of a tablesync:
case A) if we are copying neither pk nor unique fields then we may do a simple insert of all data
case B) else if we are copying pk and/or unique field, but the pk isn't auto-incremented then we may do insert on duplicate update
		actually maybe this works even if pk is auto if we are also copying the pk?
case C) else (if pk is auto generated and we're copying pk or unique key)





- if we are copying neither pk nor unique fields then we may do a simple insert of all data
- else if we are A: copying PK, or B: not copying PK but copying unique fields AND pk is not auto incremented then we may do insert on duplicate update

. else (if pk is auto generated and we're copying a unique key but not the pk)
	then we'll first have to figure out which rows have new uniques and which ones have old(ones that already exist in target DB).
	How is this done? When a tableSync compares DB's with compareField being a unique-field and operator is != then we can save the unique-values to the table-object, so if this list is present then we can use that.
	otherwise we'll just have to do a select-query checking which ones are new and which are old.
	simply insert the new ones. if the update-rows or columns aren't many then issue a simple update statement with switch case, otherwise create temporary table, insert all update rows then copy the updates from the temp table.
