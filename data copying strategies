Notes on copying data from source to target db

When about to start comparing the 2 databases, lock all tables in both databases.

Examine what fields are being copied.

Then when copying data of a tablesync:
case A) if there is no pk and we aren't copying any uniques then we may do a simple insert of all data
case B) else if there is a pk which we are copying, or if there is no pk but we are copying uniques then we may do insert on duplicate ignore
case C) else(there is a pk which we are not copying and there are uniques which we are copying) then we have to look up which uniques already exist in target db and also get their pk's.
		simply insert any rows which uniques weren't found, and do insert on duplicate update with the ones that were found, using their pk
